#This contant is the path to the folder containing the image slices. Change it to wherever your images are stored. 
#Make sure this path is an absolute path that starts at your root directory and not a relative path that starts at the working directory.
#To make it an absolute path make sure there is a "/" in the front and it starts at the root directory
